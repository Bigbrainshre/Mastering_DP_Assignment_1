Here are some of the insights into the solutions

For Question-1

1. I used the Bounded Knapsack Alg where we divide the item by using powers of two and then use the 0/1 Knapsack Alg to solve the rest of the problem.

2. To keep track of the quantity bought for each item, I just made extra vectors to back-track once my solution was complete.

3. I then just printed each time the customer bought something and each tmie we had to take a laon or restock something.


For Question-2

1. I just used the a similar algorithm as last time where in I just saved the optimal choises in a 2D array.

2. In the calculations I kept track of the last cell I was in and also the cell that I am investigating

3. Then I just took two cases, one where I take the cell and other whee I don't.

For Question-3

1. I assumed the the elements of the array to be greater than or equal to 0.

2. Then I just took out the maximum element, after which I counted the number of each element for every number.

3. Then I printed them according to thier count.
